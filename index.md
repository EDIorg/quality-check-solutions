# Welcome to the Quality Check Solutions

This repository contains solutions to data package quality checks.

https://EDIorg.github.io/quality-check-solutions/solutions/{checker-name}/{check-file-name}.html

Where `{checker-name}` is the name of the checker (`ECC` or `ezEML`) and `{check-file-name}` is the name of the check file sans file extension (e.g. `attributNamesUnique`).
