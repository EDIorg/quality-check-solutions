# Dataset Abstract Length

### Message:

```
Warning/Error: Dataset abstract element is a minimum of 20 words.
```

### Description:

_The abstract helps make your dataset more discoverable by allowing it to be indexed for full-text searches. It also provides a quick overview for users to determine whether the dataset is relevant to their needs._

### Solution:

To improve discoverability and clarity, ensure your abstract is at least 20 words long and includes key descriptive details. It can be helpful to include:

- A brief summary of **what** the dataset contains, **when** it was collected, and **where** it applies.
- General taxonomic information, if relevant.
- Whether the dataset is ongoing or completed.
- A short description of the methods used.
- Broad categories of measured parameters instead of listing them individually (e.g., use "nutrients" instead of listing every specific compound).
