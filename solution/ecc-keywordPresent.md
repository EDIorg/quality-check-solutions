### Description:

_Keywords help define important concepts within your dataset and improve its discoverability in searches. By choosing relevant keywords, you make it easier for others to find and understand your data._

### Solution:

To enhance searchability, add meaningful keywords that describe key aspects of your dataset. When possible, use a controlled vocabulary to ensure consistency. A good practice is to select keywords from established sources like the [LTER Controlled Vocabulary](https://vocab.lternet.edu/vocab/vocab/index.php). 

If you canâ€™t find a suitable term, try to create one that best represents your dataset, and consider submitting it to a relevant vocabulary for inclusion. This helps improve standardization and benefits the broader research community.
