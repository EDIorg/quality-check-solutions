# Taxonomic Coverage Present

### Message:

```
Info: Taxonomic coverage is present.
```

### Description:

_Including taxonomic information about the organisms in your dataset helps improve searchability and makes it easier for users to find relevant data._

### Solution:

Taxonomic coverage should be included when taxa are relevant to the dataset. 

- Use the **Taxonomic Coverage** to document all organisms associated with the study.  
- Provide taxonomic details at the **lowest available level**, ideally including both the **species binomial** (scientific name) and the **common name**, if applicable.  
- Also include **higher-level taxa** (e.g., genus, family, or order) to support broader taxonomic searches.
