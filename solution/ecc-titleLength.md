# Title Length

### Message:

```
Warning/Error: Dataset title length is less than 5 words.
```

### Description:

_A clear and descriptive title is helpful for data discovery. It's the first thing users see and assists EDI search tools._

### Solution:

Consider including details like:

* What data was collected
* Where it was gathered (geographic context, research site)
* When it was collected (time frame)

For best results, aim for a title with at least 5 words, and ideally between 7 and 20 (including prepositions and numbers).
