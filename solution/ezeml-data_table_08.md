# Record Delimiter Present

### Message:

```
Record Delimiter (e.g. \r\n) is required by EDI.
```

### Description:

_The accurate parsing of tabular data requires a record delimiter (new line character) to separate individual records. The absence of a record delimiter can lead to misinterpretation of data and errors in downstream processing._

### Solution:

Record delimiters are automatically identified when you upload a data table to ezEML. To solve this issue, [re-upload the data table](https://ezeml.edirepository.org/static/user_guide/re-uploading_data_tables.pdf?version=2024.10.30) to ezEML.
