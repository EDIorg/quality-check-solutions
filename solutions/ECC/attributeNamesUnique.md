# Attribute Names Unique

### Message:

```
Warning/Error: Attribute names are unique
```

### Description:

_Ensuring that a **data table** has **unique attribute names** (i.e. **column names**) prevents ambiguity when referencing attributes. Duplicate attribute names can lead to errors in **data processing, analysis, and interpretation**._

### Solution:

Make sure that **all attribute names within a data entity are unique**. If duplicate names exist, update them to be distinct while maintaining clarity and consistency with the dataset's structure.
