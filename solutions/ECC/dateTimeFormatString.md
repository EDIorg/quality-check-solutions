# Date Time Format String

### Message:

```
Warning/Error: dateTime/formatString specified in metadata is from a preferred set of values
```

### Description:

_To ensure the publication of **unambiguous temporal data**, a set of preferred date and time format strings is used. Using these formats helps with **data validation, consistency, and accurate interpretation** across different systems._

### Solution:

Make sure that the **date and time format string** in your metadata is one of the **preferred formats**. These formats help prevent confusion and ensure proper validation of the underlying data.
