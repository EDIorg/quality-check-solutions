# Duplicate Entity Name

### Message:

```
Warning/Error: There are no duplicate entity names.
```

### Description:

_Each data entity (data file) should have a unique name to avoid ambiguity. Missing or duplicate names can make it difficult to correctly reference and parse data entities, leading to errors when reading metadata and data._

### Solution:

Ensure that every data entity (data file) has a **non-empty, unique name** in the metadata. 

- Assign a **descriptive, meaningful name** to each entity to help with identification.  
- Check for and remove any duplicate entity names to prevent confusion.  

Providing clear and distinct names for data entities improves metadata readability and ensures smooth data processing.
