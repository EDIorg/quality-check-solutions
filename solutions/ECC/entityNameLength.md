# Entity Name Length

### Message:

```
Warning/Error: Length of entityName is not excessive (less than 100 char)
```

### Description:

_An excessively long **data entity name** can lead to **file system storage errors** and may complicate data processing and readability._

### Solution:

- Use a **concise and meaningful** name for the data entity. If additional details are needed, include them in the **data entity description** instead.  
- **Replace spaces with underscores (`_`)** in file names to improve compatibility and avoid potential issues with different operating systems and software.
