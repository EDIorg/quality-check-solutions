# Methods Element Present

### Message:

```
Warning/Error: A 'methods' element is present
```


### Description:

_Documenting the **methods** used to create a dataset is crucial for helping users understand its **usability, reproducibility, and reliability**._

### Solution:

At a minimum, provide a **reference to an external protocol** at the dataset level. However, a more detailed description at this level is preferable.  

If further refinement is needed, methods can also be documented at:  
- The **data entity level** (for individual files or tables).  
- The **attribute level** (for specific variables).  

Since method descriptions are primarily for **human interpretation**, a **single, detailed description at the dataset level** is often sufficient and provides a more user-friendly approach.
