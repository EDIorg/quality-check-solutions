Info: 'numFooterLines' element is present
```

### Description:

_If **footer lines** are included in the metadata, the **congruence checker** identifies them and processes the data entity accordingly._

### Solution:

No action is required for this check. It serves as an **internal service** to confirm whether the data entity contains footer lines as described in the metadata and ensures they are handled correctly.
