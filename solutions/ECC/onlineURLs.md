# Online URLs

### Message:

```
Warning/Error: Online URLs are live
```

### Description:

_If **online URLs** are listed for data entities, they should be **active** and allow the repository to download the data without any issues._

### Solution:

If this issue arises for one or more data entities:  
- **Double-check the URL** to ensure it is correctly entered and accessible.  
- **Verify that the URL allows public downloads** so the repository can retrieve the data entity as expected.
