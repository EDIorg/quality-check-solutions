# Package Id Pattern

### Message:

```
Warning/Error: packageId pattern matches "scope.identifier.revision"
```

### Description:

_Each data package must have a **package identifier** that follows the expected format. A **well formed identifier** ensures successful publication and proper versioning of the data package._


### Solution:

Ensure that the **package identifier** follows the correct format:  

- **Scope** – Typically a site-specific acronym or organizational identifier.  
- **Identifier** – A unique whole number assigned to the data package.  
- **Revision** – A whole number representing the version of the package.  

For example:

_edi.1234.1_

In this case, `edi` is the scope, `1234` is the identifier, and `1` is the revision number.
