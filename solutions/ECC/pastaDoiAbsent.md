# PASTA Doi Absent

### Message:

```
Warning/Error: An alternateIdentifier with a DOI system attribute that looks like it is generated by PASTA should not be present
```

### Description:

_A **DOI** should **not** be included in the **alternateIdentifier** element when uploading a dataset to the repository. The repository will automatically **generate a new DOI** upon upload, replacing any previous DOI._

### Solution:

Ensure that there is **no PASTA-related DOI** in the **alternateIdentifier** element before uploading the dataset.

**Note:**  
This issue often occurs when **revising a dataset's metadata**. If the original metadata record was retrieved from the repository, it may contain a **DOI that was inserted during a prior upload**. Be sure to remove this before submitting the update.
