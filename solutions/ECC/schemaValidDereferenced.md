# Schema Valid Dereferenced

### Message:

```
Warning/Error: Dereferenced document is schema-valid EML
```

### Description:

_If **identifier and reference elements** do not align in the **metadata**, it can lead to **parsing errors** and **potential information loss**._

### Solution:

If this issue occurs, ensure that **reference elements correctly link back** to their respective **identifiers** throughout the metadata document.

To help identify and resolve these issues, we recommend using the **EMLvp Python package**. You can access this package here: https://github.com/PASTAplus/EMLvp.
