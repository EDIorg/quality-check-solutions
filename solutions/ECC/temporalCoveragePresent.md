# Temporal Coverage Present

### Message:

```
Info: temporalCoverage is present.
```

### Description:

_Providing clear temporal coverage improves dataset discoverability and helps users quickly assess whether the dataset aligns with their research needs._

### Solution:

Temporal coverage refers to the **time period over which the data were collected**, rather than the year the study was conducted (which may use historical or retrospective data). 

- In most cases, a **date range** is used to define the temporal extent.  
- In some cases, an **alternative time scale** may be more appropriate, such as "years before present" for datasets like long-term tree ring chronologies.  
- Temporal coverage should be formatted in one of the following ways:  
  - A **4-digit year** (e.g., `1998`)  
  - A **full date in ISO format** (`YYYY-MM-DD`, e.g., `1998-06-15`)
